## `duplicateLayer` drops `blendMode`, and now `alphaMask` too (2026-08-13)

`CanvasManager+LayerTree.swift`'s `duplicateLayer(at:)` builds the copy's `Layer` without carrying
over `source.blendMode` or `source.alphaMask`, so both silently reset to their defaults (`.normal`,
`nil`). The `blendMode` gap dates from phase 5a; phase 6a left it in place rather than fold a
phase-5 behaviour change into a phase-6 diff, so `alphaMask` now drops the same way. Wants its own
commit plus a test.

## Fill tool: the gap-closing UI test is still skipped (2026-07-21)

`testFillToolBridgesOpenContourGapWhenGapClosingEnabled` is `XCTSkip`'d, and it is the single skip in
every clean full run. Three separate causes were found and fixed along the way (an originally
unbridgeable gap, `app.sliders.firstMatch` grabbing the wrong slider, and a synthetic drag too near
the screen edge dropping the next stroke) and the final containment assertion still fails. Next
steps: re-point the "outside" probe using `visibleCanvasBounds`/`safeOutsideCornerPoint`; if it still
fails, call `FloodFillEngine.fill` directly on synthetic wall data to tell a real leak from a
test-probe bug — the morphology math itself is verified correct in isolation. Re-enable by deleting
the `throw XCTSkip(...)` at the top of the test body.

## Duplicate is a silent no-op against an adjacent neighbour (2026-07-28)

The overlap bug behind this is fixed (the shared frame-length clamp filters `>= startFrame`), but
when a neighbour starts at exactly the source's end frame there is zero free space, so Duplicate
correctly does nothing — with no feedback at all. Worth greying the control out when
`clampedCelLength` returns nil. The alternatives that aren't a no-op — place the copy at the next
free run, or shift later cels rightward — are timeline feature design and a separate decision.

## Switching brush presets resets live size/opacity (2026-07-22)

`selectBrush` re-baselines `brushSize`/`brushOpacity` from the preset, so re-tapping the current
brush throws away a size the user just dialled in. Partly intentional per its doc comment — needs a
product call, not just a fix.

## Missing / stubbed, as designed

- Distort/Warp transform modes render and gesture identically to Uniform but still appear in the Move
  bottom-bar picker.
- Adjust panel and ActionsMenu's Cut/Copy/Paste/Drawing Guide are "Coming soon"; the timeline block
  menu's "Select Multiple" is permanently disabled.
- No UI to change `fps` (fixed at 24) or edit scene length directly.
- Square/custom brushes are tiled round dabs, not true shaped stamps (scalloped edges, seam
  build-up); per-stamp `.normal` compositing makes slow strokes read darker than fast ones.

## Cleanup opportunities

- **Duplicated transform-overlay code** — `ObjectTransformOverlayView` and `FloatingPieceOverlayView`
  each define their own `HandleView` and near-identical project/rotate/resize logic.
- **Duplicated canvas-flip geometry** — `CanvasManager.flippedImage` and `RasterLayerTexture.flipped`
  implement the same mirror-about-centre draw twice.
- **`ContentView.saveIfNeeded`** fires only on scene-phase change and Return-to-Gallery, so a direct
  project→project transition would silently drop unsaved work. Currently safe only because every
  entry point goes through the gallery first.
- **A vector cel still carries `fillImage`/`bakedImage`**, so raster features allocate canvas-sized
  bitmaps on a vector layer. The product owner wants vector fully divorced from raster —
  [VECTOR_INTERPOLATION.md](VECTOR_INTERPOLATION.md) §4 item 26 is the full write-up.
