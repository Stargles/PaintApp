# TODO

The owner's asks. [BUGS.md](BUGS.md) is for what *we* find.

## How to read and keep this file

Every item is a **status**, a short **description** a future session can pick up cold, and **what is
left** as a checklist. Items are in **queue order** — the top of the list is what to do next.

**An item leaves this file when it is merged, not when a branch exists**, and it leaves *whole* rather
than being marked done: `git log` and the spec documents are the history. The owner, 2026-09-06:
*"Basically I want to be able to read the tasks on TODO clearly without already finished tasks."*

**Three in flight at once** unless the extras need no simulator — the cap is about the machine, not the
plan (`tools/simlock.sh`).

**Before adding an item, check whether an existing one already covers it in different words.** A
restatement filed as a new item is how one feature came to be specified in six documents at three
scopes before a line of it was written. This file has since carried two live duplicates for weeks.

**Record an ask in the owner's own words, and fold a ruling into the item it rules on.** A quote is
cheaper to keep than a decision is to rebuild. But an item reads as *one current description*, not as
the transcript of the argument that produced it — what happened this pass belongs in
[HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) and in `git log`.

**Cite a symbol, not a line number.** A 2026-09-06 audit found ~10 of one item's 15 `FILE:LINE`
citations and 5 of another's 11 no longer resolved — every named fact still true, every anchor wrong,
two of them because a file moved directory. A symbol name survives a refactor and a line does not.

**A bare item number in a spec or a code comment may name an item that has already left this file.**
That is the merge rule working, not a dangling reference: `git log` and the spec documents are where a
completed number resolves. Two are cited often enough to name here — **(10a)**, the Oklab colour ramps,
and **(38)**, the graph editor's bezier tangent handles and their tap grammar. Do not re-add a finished
item to this file to make a citation resolve.

**Verify a status before trusting it, including this file's own.** That same audit found fourteen
assertions here that the code contradicted — features called unbuilt that shipped weeks ago, a blocker
called live that had lifted, and two commit shas that are not on `main`.

**No document written so far has to survive.** The owner, 2026-08-27: *"Don't worry about legacy
documents right now, everything on the ipad right now is expendable."* A format change needs no
migration and no "existing documents change appearance" warning. This is standing permission, and it
lapses the day the owner starts keeping real artwork in the app — whoever notices that should say so
rather than assuming it still holds.

**The measurement baseline is [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) §1, not here**: the owner works at
2048x1024, and every figure taken before 2026-08-17 was at 4096², eight times the pixels.

## (27) Stream the computer's screen as a layer

**Status** — briefed by the owner 2026-09-13; design conversation open; not started. Promoted from
"Later" — it *"requires (26)"* and (26), video import, is merged. Spec to be written at
[STREAM.md](STREAM.md) once the questions below are answered.

**The owner's brief, 2026-09-13, verbatim in the numbered points:**

1. *"The purpose of this feature is to be able to stream my windows computer's screen as a layer live
   on the app. The example use case is that the user will open up blender on their computer, then
   rotoscope a character, move the camera around in the computer, then continue rotoscoping, etc."*
2. *"This feature will require another app that is to be installed on my windows laptop which will
   stream the video to the Ipad."*
3. *"The windows app should also have a drop box for videos or images which when they are pasted into
   or uploaded, will appear on the app via the import video or image feature. If it is also possible,
   make the ipad app able to export to the windows app and save to the laptop."*
4. *"In the app, the stream tool should be under actions, and like a video it makes its own layer with
   the stream object inside of it."*
5. *"When the user is actively on the layer, there should be an options bar (the same kind as move or
   lasso tool), and in it should be the option to freeze the stream, or to bake the current frame. When
   the user presses bake to frame, the current frame in the layer is split as a new cel, and in that
   cel will be an image of the screen when it was baked. For example there are 4 frames and the stream
   layer has one cel stretching the 4 frames. The user is currently on cel 2. Once they hit bake, the
   cel will split into 3 cels: frame 1, frame 2, and frame 3 to 4. the cels in frame 1 and frame 3 to 4
   will not change. However, the cel in frame 2 will have the stream object replaced with an image
   object containing the snapshot of that frame."*
6. *"The paintapp streamer should be low latency and should not lag the main thread. Running it in a
   background thread might be smart, your decision. Note that for the most part, the computer side
   wont move."*
7. *"Just like a video layer, the user should be able to move the stream object in the layer using the
   move tool. The architecture for this is already well established."*
8. *"Note that the user may potentially use many screens or just want to stream a specific app."*
9. *"Note, this part is for the far future. I eventually intend to make the paint app compatible with
   windows, and thus there is the idea that instead of having a separate app, the paint app itself
   contains the streamer. This is a far off feature, but in case the two apps eventually merge, put
   some thought into the design of the architecture of the computer side streamer app. Better to plan
   ahead for potential future changes."*
10. *"There is the case the user may actively stream, then turn off their computer and continue on the
    app, then turn the computer back on and continue streaming."*
11. *"stream layers actively moving do not have to be rendered."*
12. *"The laptop that I want the streamer app in is not this mac but my windows computer. You should
    see it through tailscale."* — it is `desktop-cbr0fl6`, `100.104.85.111` on the tailnet; the iPad is
    `100.70.220.4`. SSH on the Windows box was **closed** on 2026-09-13 and needs the owner to enable
    OpenSSH Server before any Windows-side work can happen from this Mac.

**What is left**
- [ ] Design conversation → STREAM.md (wire protocol, capture source picker, freeze/bake semantics,
      reconnect after the computer is off, the drop box and the reverse export).
- [ ] Windows streamer app (capture core separable from the shell, per point 9).
- [ ] iPad: stream layer kind/object, Actions entry, options bar (Freeze / Bake Frame), move-tool
      support, persistence of the last frame so the layer survives the computer being off.
- [ ] Drop box → import; iPad export → laptop.
- [ ] Drive it end to end with the real Windows box before calling it done.

## (64) Transform-layer settings go in the bottom menu

**Status** — asked 2026-09-13, not started.

*"the settings in the transform layer (example: shake x, shake y, etc. in shake mode) should be the
bottom menu, like the effect settings for effects."*

**What is left**
- [ ] Move the per-mode parameters (shake x/y, parallax, rotate, repeat, duplicate offset) out of
      wherever they live now into the same bottom panel the effect settings use.

---

## (65) HSV Shift and Hue Colorize are one menu entry

**Status** — asked 2026-09-13, not started. `Effect.Kind.hsvShift` already carries `colorize` as a
mode (TODO (60)); the menu still lists it twice.

*"I'm not sure why HSV Shift and Hue Colorize are two different options. Make them one with just a
toggle (toggle is already implemented)."*

**What is left**
- [ ] One entry in the effect picker; the existing toggle selects colorize. Existing documents
      with either variant must open unchanged.

---

## (66) Organise the Effect / blend-mode menu with headers

**Status** — asked 2026-09-13, not started.

*"The Effect / blend mode option menu should be organized. Use headers to organize them into groups."*

**What is left**
- [ ] Group the 18 effects and 25 blend modes under section headers in the picker.

---

## (67) Effect settings must not cancel on a two-finger canvas move

**Status** — asked 2026-09-13, not started.

*"The effect settings menus cancels when you move the canvas with two fingers. For example, color
wheels. There is already an X at the top right corner for that."*

**What is left**
- [ ] The bottom effect-settings panel stays open through a two-finger pan/zoom; only the X closes it.
      Check whether the transform-layer panel from (64) and the other bottom panels share the dismissal.

---

## (22) Select multiple cels at once

**Status** — not started, and **deprioritised by the owner 2026-09-07**. The menu row exists and is `.disabled(true)` with an empty action; no
cel-selection state exists. The keyframe half of the same idea is real and shipping.

---

## (10) Linear light as an option on the blend mode

**Status** — not started, and **deprioritised by the owner**.

No colour-pipeline setting, no sRGB/linear enum, no transfer LUT, no `Composite.metal` change.

**One adjacent strand did ship**: `ColorMath`'s sRGB↔linear and Oklab conversions feed the gradient
map, which is this item's own "Oklab still gets built, for interpolation" half. The code calls that
**(10a)** in eight places, corrected 2026-09-07 from a stale count of nine — `Effect.gradientTable`,
`EffectSection`, `ColorMathOklabLogicTests`, `EffectParityLogicTests` and `tools/oklab_ramp_ab.swift`
among them. It is finished, so it left this file by the merge rule and the citations stand; see the
convention above.

## (37) The brush engine — one stage, and the owner has dropped it

**Status** — stages 0 through 11 merged. **Stage 12, the importers, is dropped for now by the owner**
(2026-09-06: *"skip the importer for now"*), so there is nothing actionable in this item today.

Twenty brushes in five groups with every asset generated and no third-party content; opacity and flow
split with a per-stroke buffer; canvas-anchored texture; the brushes menu and the full-screen editor
with orderable module chains, noise octaves and second inputs; relocatable storage; two-axis scatter.

**Left, when the owner wants it**
- [ ] Stage 12 — the `.abr` / Procreate `.brushset` / Clip Studio `.sut` importers. All three are
      undocumented and reverse-engineered, so the stage opens with a survey against real files, not
      with a parser. Test files are a real dependency. §2.21 makes it an **adapter** onto §6's
      modulation matrix rather than a bitmap reader.

**Owner-side, not ours**: their tuning pass over the other nineteen presets, and driving a real Pencil
to exercise tilt, which no test here can reach. BRUSH.md §13 has **nine** genuinely open questions
(recounted 2026-09-07 — the sixteen bullets split seven answered/closed, nine still open; the "eight"
recorded here was a miscount on the day this line was written, not later drift). Three of the nine
were offered on 2026-09-06 and declined; which three is not recorded here and could not be verified
against a transcript this audit does not have.

**Spec** BRUSH.md — **§2 is thirty-three owner rulings.**

## Later — the long-term features

**None of these are designed, and each needs its own conversation with the owner before it starts.**

- **(28) Audio.** Its stated blocker is **gone** — `PlaybackClock` is a drift-free wall-clock frame
  counter on the model, delivered by RENDER stage 1, which is exactly the hoist this item said it
  needed. `AVFoundation` is linked (for video), though no audio playback code exists.
- **(30) Video editor.** Its RENDER dependency is met — (29) shipped in full on 2026-09-06.
- **(35) Advanced masks** — colour-range masks and a colour-reassign blend mode. `MaskSource` has two
  cases and there are 25 blend modes with no reassign.
---

## Carried — deliberate, and not an ask

- **The raster Move's undo half.** `finalizePendingGesturesForHistoryAction` has fill, shape and text
  arms and no raster-float arm.
- **Freeform text's minimum-size exemption** is still unruled.
