/// The scene is a closed box of line art with a divider down the middle, on one layer, and the fills

/// point, so a fill that grows one pixel too far fails as loudly as one that does not grow at all:
/// the divider's pixels between the cells are covered; **the frame's own ink, the paper outside it,
/// and the caps of the divider above and below the cells are not**; and the neighbour's pixels are
